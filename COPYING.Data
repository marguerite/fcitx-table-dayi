Translation:

These tables are authorized by Dayi Software Corp (http://www.dayi.com).
They are open to download and use.
You can not change the encoding rule of any character in these tables,
and then redistribute with the modified encoding rules. 
But you can change the format of these tables for other OS platforms 
or input method frameworks and redistribute.

==========================================

Explanation:

It's reasonable not to give permission to change the "encoding rule"
which are basically mappings. If you change the mapping:
1. the core of any table input method is the table/mappings itself. 
If you change it, it'll no longer be that input method.
2. the modified mappings will surely not be compatible with Dayi's product
on Windows platform and may even not be usable. both cases will hurt
the name of Dayi.

Bascially, those tables are freeware and can be licensed under SUSE-Freeware 
or similar licenses.
